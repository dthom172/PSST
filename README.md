## Overview:

The Polygenic SNP Search Tool is an open-source pipeline that **identifies multiple SNPs that are associated with diseases**; including SNPs that modify the *penetrance* of other SNPs. This pipeline identifies:
* Asserted pathogenic SNPs
* Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS) identified SNPs
, crossed with database and datasets such as ClinVar, SRA, and GEO, and then constructs a report describing multiple genetic variants associated with diseases.


## Usage:

The script `psst.sh` determines the set of SNPs that are contained in each SRA dataset associated with the given phenotype/disease. For example, to determine the set of SNPs associated with each SRA dataset related to breast-ovarian cancer, run the command `psst.sh breast-ovarian_cancer ${PWD}`. This script will then output a TSV file describing which SNPs are associated with the breast-ovarian cancer SRA datasets. 

The `psst.sh` subpipeline is as follows:

1. Extracts flanking sequences for the phenotype associated SNP IDs and creates a FASTA file containing these flanking sequences. 

2. Uses `makeblastdb` to generate a BLAST database for the SNP flanking sequences.

3. Runs Magic-BLAST on each phenotype-associated SRA dataset and the SNP flanking sequence BLAST database.

4. From the Magic-BLAST alignments, determines which SNPs are contained in the SRA datasets using a statistical heuristic.

5. For each SRA dataset, outputs the set of IDs of the associated SNPs. 

## Disease Clustering:

Clustering disease types through the ClinVar database in various categories such as assorted metabolic diseases and breast cancer to see the relationship among human variations and phenotypes.
