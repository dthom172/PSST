# PSST
Polygenic SNP Search Tool

## Overview

Here is what this pipeline does: We are developing a software *pipeline* to **identify multiple SNPs that are associated with diseases**; including SNPs that modify the *penetrance* of other SNPs. We are looking to identify:
* Asserted pathogenic SNPs
* Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS) identified SNPs
, crossed with database and datasets such as ClinVar, SRA, and GEO, and then build a pipeline for multiple genetic variants associated with diseases.

## Usage

### Step 1

## Module 1

This software generates sequences for SNP IDs of a certain disease, and then you can make blastdb.  It fits into the general scheme of this pipeline <here>.
